Foreign Object Debris (FOD) is a persistent challenge in the aviation industry and can damage aircraft engines, tires, and critical components, and endanger the safety of flight operations.

The main objective of this project is to detect FOD in aerodromes through images using machine learning approaches namely YOLO which implements a simple deep convolutional network (DCNN)
Training is performed on a large dataset of varying FOD in different weather conditions so as to pertain proper detection.
